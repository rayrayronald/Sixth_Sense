# Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled precision molecular diagnostics for smartphones (professional app)

Imperial College London Department of Bioengineering
MEng Group Project 


## Getting Started

This Third Year Biomedical Engineering project aims to build an android app that conencts to a disposable, low cost, non-self powered electrochemical sensing hardware.

### Prerequisites
Requirements to run through development IDE, direct APK installation is NOT recommended
```
Android Studio IDE
Android device (physical or emulated)
Android SDK 15+ on device to be run
```

### Installing

1. Download the source files and locate them on your system directory
2. Import project into Android Studio
3. Clean Project and Rebuild Project under "Build" if build error occurs
4. Run app on connected android device using device manager


## Main file locations

Java:
```
/app/src/main/java/com/example/sixth_sense
```
XML:
```
/app/src/main/res/layout
```
Android Manifest:
```
/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
```

## Deployment

To enable NFC fucntion testing, a physical Android device with NFC support is needed. Select from main menu
```
Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK > Build APK
```
and locate the APK at 
```
app⁩/⁨build⁩/outputs⁩/apk⁩/debug⁩
```
